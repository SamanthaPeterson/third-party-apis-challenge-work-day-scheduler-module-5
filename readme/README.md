# third-party-apis-challenge-work-day-scheduler-module-5

The purpose of this project is to help a user plan out a busy workday. This daily scheduler has been designed to allow the user to click in the empty text and entry box, note appointments, meetings, or to-dos for the day. Moreover, the nice thing is that if you click the save button on the side to the right, the information you just typed in for your day is saved in your local storage, so you can review that information until you remove it or change it. 
I always find myself writing things I need to do down on sticky notes or small pieces of paper, or I think of things I need to do in my head, so theyâ€™re scattered. This would be such a helpful tool to keep everything in one place and map out what you needed to accomplish in your day. I have heard by quite a few people that it helps if you make small, attainable, and achievable goals, and I think this is a ticket to that.

Your Task Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. Learn more about some alternative solutions in the Moment.js project status page.
